This equation is pretty easy to solve--it's just a matter of multiplying 5 by whatever x is equal to. In this case, x is equal to 4, so 5 times 4 equals 20. In order to solve for X, you can either divide both sides of the equation by 5, or you can multiply both sides of the equation by 2/5. The data is not accurate because the people who are taking the data are not taking it correctly. 1/5 is the same thing as dividing by 5 if you know the difference between dividing and multiplying fractions. This gets the same thing. As a creative highschool student, I am always looking for new and innovative ways to express myself and my ideas. I enjoy using my imagination to create unique pieces of art, whether it be through writing, painting, or photography. I am also passionate about using my creativity to help others, whether it be through teaching or volunteering. I believe that creativity is essential in all aspects of life, and I strive to use my creativity to make a positive impact on the world around me. In order to find the y-intercept of a linear equation, we can plug in a known point on the line and solve for b. For example, if we know that the point (4, 3) is on the line, we can plug those values into the equation and solve for b. We would get:

3 = 4m + b

b = 3 - 4m

So, the y-intercept of the line is 3 - 4m In mathematics, the distributive property is a rule that allows one to multiply a single term outside of a set of parentheses by each term inside the parentheses. This rule is often used to simplify algebraic expressions. For example, if one were to multiply the expression 3x(4 + 5), they could use the distributive property to simplify this to 3x4 + 3x5. We can see that the answer is -1.0256410256410256. I like to leave my fractions in proper form because it is easier to deal with them. You could also do that. That's -1 just wanted to write as a mixed number. In this equation, we are trying to solve for x. To do this, we first need to get all of the terms that contain x on one side of the equation, and all of the terms that do not contain x on the other side. To do this, we need to add 3/4 to both sides. This will cancel out the -3/4 on the left side, and will give us 10/13 on the right side. We can then multiply both sides by In mathematics, the reciprocal of a number is defined as the number's multiplicative inverse, or the number of times one must divide one by the number in order to get one. In other words, the reciprocal of a number is the number that, when multiplied by the original number, yields a product of one. For example, the reciprocal of five is one-fifth, the reciprocal of ten is one-tenth, and the reciprocal of two is one-half.

The This equation is asking us to find the value of x when 7x=-21. In order to solve this, we need to divide both sides by 7. This will give us x=-3.
