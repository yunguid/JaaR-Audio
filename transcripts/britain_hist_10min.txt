The conversation discusses the search for new premises for a government agency, specifically MI6 headquarters. Initially, several options were ruled out due to the need to share space with Schultz restaurants or have private conversations. Locations outside London were also eliminated due to the distance from other government agencies.

The building was intended to house the Department of the Environment, but it was mistakenly revealed to be the headquarters of MI6. The question raised is how to keep such a secret from the people involved in the construction to avoid future embarrassment. Unfortunately, there are no actionable items provided in the conversation.
